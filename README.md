# StardrewAutoFishing
A Stardrew Valley fish bot, under development.

At the current stage, detection of fish position and fishing bar position is finished (there is a bug when treasure is present) 
as well as the action part (i.e. click to move the fishing bar).

A primitive controller is implemented. It is able to catch some easy fish perfectly and some middle hard fishes.

You can already try it out.

Next step is to fix the treasure bug.
