# StardrewAutoFishing
A Stardrew Valley fish bot, under development.

At the current stage, detection of fish position and fishing bar position is finished (there is a bug when treasure is present) 
as well as the action part (i.e. click to move the fishing bar).

Next step is to implement a controller to track the fish position.

After a controller is available, the treasure bug is to be fixed.
